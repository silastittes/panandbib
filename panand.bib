  annote={from significance statement: "Plant functional traits—characteristics that influence performance or fitness—are increasingly being used to model important ecosystem properties such as primary production. These approaches assume that traits confer specific functions or responses under given environmental conditions, and that these trait–environment and trait–function relationships can be generalized globally irrespective of a region's history or differences in species assemblages. Here, we test this assumption in grasslands with distinct histories and find that different combinations of trait values can yield similar productivity–precipitation relationships. Our study highlights a missing link in the development of trait-based approaches to modeling ecosystem function, namely that there is not necessarily a single solution or set of traits that yields higher function in a given environment."}

	abstract = {Maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) is not only one of the world{\textquoteright}s most important crops, but it also is a powerful tool for studies of genetics, genomics, and cytology. The genome of maize shows the unmistakable signature of an ancient hybridization event followed by whole genome duplication (allopolyploidy), but the parents of this event have been a mystery for over a century, since studies of maize cytogenetics began. Here we show that the whole genome duplication event preceded the divergence of the entire genus Zea and its sister genus Tripsacum. One genome was donated, in whole or in part, by a plant related to the modern African genera Urelytrum and Vossia, although genomic rearrangement has been extensive. The other genome donor is less well-supported, but may have been related to the modern Rottboellia-Hemarthria clade, which is also African. Thus Zea and Tripsacum together represent a New World radiation derived from African ancestors.},

abstract = { Artificial selection has produced varieties of domesticated maize which thrive in temperate climates around the world. However, the direct progenitor of maize, teosinte, is indigenous only to a relatively small range of tropical and sub-tropical latitudes and grows poorly or not at all outside of this region. Tripsacum, a sister genus to maize and teosinte, is naturally endemic to the majority of areas in the western hemisphere where maize is cultivated. A full-length reference transcriptome for Tripsacum dactyloides generated using long-read Iso-Seq data was used to characterize independent adaptation to temperate climates in this clade. Genes related to phospholipid biosynthesis, a critical component of cold acclimation in other cold adapted plant lineages, were enriched among those genes experiencing more rapid rates of protein sequence evolution in T. dactyloides. In contrast with previous studies of parallel selection, we find that there is a significant overlap between the genes which were targets of artificial selection during the adaptation of maize to temperate climates and those which were targets of natural selection in temperate adapted T. dactyloides. Genes related to growth, development, response to stimulus, signaling, and organelles were enriched in the set of genes identified as both targets of natural and artificial selection.

	abstract = {Convergent adaptation is the independent evolution of similar traits conferring a fitness advantage in two or more lineages. Cases of convergent adaptation inform our ideas about the ecological and molecular basis of adaptation. In judging the degree to which putative cases of convergent adaptation provide independent replication of the process of adaptation, it is necessary to establish the degree to which the evolutionary change is unexpected under null models and to show that selection has repeatedly, independently driven these changes. Here, we discuss the issues that arise from these questions particularly for closely-related populations, where gene flow and standing variation add additional layers of complexity. We outline a conceptual framework to guide intuition as to the extent to which evolutionary change represents the independent gain of information due to selection and show that this is a measure of how surprised we should be by convergence. Additionally, we summarize the ways population and quantitative genetics and genomics may help us address questions related to convergent adaptation, as well as open new questions and avenues of research.},
